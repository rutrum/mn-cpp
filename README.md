# Calculating M(n)

## Summary of Files

* `alg` Algorithms used to calculate delta(n).
    * `a0Free.h` Calculates delta(n) in the most naive way possible.
    * `a1Free.h` Calculates delta(n) by skipping the first row of the table.
    * `a2Free.h` Calculates delta(n) working modulo 2.
    * `a3Free.h` Calculates delta(n) working modulo 6.
    * `a4Free.h` Calculates delta(n) working modulo 12.
    * `a5Free.h` Calculates delta(n) working modulo 60.
    * `aNFree.h` Calculates delta(n) for a variable modulus, that is, the least common multiple of integers 1 to N.  First it creates a series of vectors that stores "step" data, that is, how to traverse across the multiplication table under modulo N.
    * `aModN.h` BROKEN. Calculates delta(n) under ANY modulus.
    * `aFast.h` BAD. Calculates particular delta(n) using constant time evaluation rules.  Supports n=p*k, for prime p and k <= 16. Done using a series of switch statements.
    * `aHash.h` Calculates particular delta(n) using constant time evaluation rules.  Supports n=p*k, for prime p. Reads from the `constants` folder to create a series of hashmaps to evaluate the rules.  Those files were generated by another program.
    * `aShift.h` Implementation of Algorithm 3.  Calculates families of delta(n) values.  For a multiplier m, it calculates delta(mp) for prime p.
    * `aFill.h` Implementation of Algorithm 4.
    * `nine_rules.h` and `three_up_fast_rules.h` are switch statements used in `aFast.h`
* `util` Functions and structs used across many algorithms.
    * `Sieve.h` Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation.
    * `Factoration.h` Struct that represents the factorization of a given number.
    * `fastFact.h` Segmented sieve that creates factorization structs across an interval.
    * `freeFunc.h` Functions used in the initialization of `aXFree.h` algorithms.
    * `shiftFunc.h` Functions used in `aShift.h` and `aFill.h`.
* `test` Performs the actual M(n) calculation leveraging a variety of different algorithms described above.  For example, `tFast12Free.cpp` uses the `aFast.h`, `a1Free.h`, and `a2Free.h` files.
    * `PSegNFree.cpp` Performed the M(n) calculation in parallel to get M(2^30).
* `sh` Bash scripts that validate the test the files in `test` to ensure algorithms provide the correct delta(n) and M(n) calculations.
* `constants` Data used to initialize the hashmap in `aHash.h`
* `scripts` Some additional scripts used when parsing M(n) values.
* `step_generator` Constructs files with all the different step values need to run aNFree.h.  Used when creating a new `aXFree.h` algorithm.  For example, the first lines of `a5Free.h` were generated by this program.

Executables are compliled to `bin/` and output from `sh` scripts are written to `data/`.
